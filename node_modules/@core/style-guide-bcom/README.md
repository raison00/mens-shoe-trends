##  SECTION A - scss folder                                              
------
in src/scss folder:
  components folder contains all the base component partials
  `macys-base.scss` is the main file that generates macys-base.css in the end.
  `mcom-sprites.scss` is generated by dr-svg-sprites, do NOT manually modify (see Section C below).




##  SECTION B - version notes                                
------
version 0.x    --  uses Node v4.x & npm 3.x
version 0.27 and before - app package name is @core/component-style-guide
version 0.28 and beyond - app renamed to @core/style-guide
version 1.3.x  --  uses Node v8.x & npm 5.x
version 1.4.x  --  ./scss/style-guide/macys-base-12grid.scss renamed to ./src/scss/mcom/macys-base-f4-12grid.scss
                   ./scss/style-guide/macys-base.scss renamed to ./src/scss/mcom/macys-base-f4-16grid.scss
                   ./scss/style-guide/macys-base-F6-12grid.scss renamed to ./src/scss/mcom/macys-base.scss as default
                   ./scss/settings moved to brand-specific ./src/scss/mcom/settings or ./src/scss/bcom/settings directories




## Section C - Dependency
-----
1) @core/vendor is part of the Macys-Build.  No longer need to include in Package.json as dependency (v1.3.x)



##  SECTION C - Icons     
------
1) Place original SVG icons in ./icons/mcom/originals or ./icons/bcom/originals folder.  
2) Make sure to optimize all SVG icons prior to placing them in ./icons/originals folder:
      
      * Double check that all icons are per spec: Artboard dimension of 40x40px, 1px border all around (actual icon takes up max 38x38px)

      * Open the generated svg in Adobe Illustrator, save the file with 1 decimal place(instead of the default 3). http://www.adobe.com/inspire/2013/09/exporting-svg-illustrator.html

      * Run npm svgo to optimize the svg file (file size should shrink)
      'svgo --pretty MacysUI/macysCSS/src/mcom/sprites/final/mcom-sprite.svg'
       if you don't have svgo installed, run 'npm install -g svgo'
       https://web-design-weekly.com/2014/10/22/optimizing-svg-web/

3) In command line at root folder, run `npm run base64-icons <brand>` to generate base64-encoded icons and its respective scss class (found in ./src/scss/mcom/encodedIcons or ./src/scss/bcom/encodedIcons folder).  If no brand is specified, mcom will be run.  
4) PREFERRED METHOD - @import desired icons's scss file in your scss, then you can proceed to use the css class name in your CSS
5) FOR LEGACY SUPPORT ONLY, NOT RECOMMENDED MOVING FORWARD (DUE TO FILE SIZE) - 
      If you need to generate a sprite, run `npm run gen-sprite <brand>` to generate the sprite scss. The resulting sprite scss can be found in ./src/scss/<brand>-sprites.scss.
      If no brand is specified, mcom will be run.
