// Can't include this here because of how MEW:
// - Has a core-common.scss that @import's this file to generate the core-common.css
// - Is @importing this file for its scss source (mixins/variables) to generate main.css
// By specifying normalize and fonts here, it ends up including them in both css files.
// This would be nice: https://github.com/Compass/compass/tree/master/import-once
