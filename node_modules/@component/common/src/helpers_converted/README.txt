This directory exists so that the core can build with common helpers for server-side rendering.

The current issue is that not all helpers in src/helpers can be run on node, which breaks at compile-time.

There needs to be a follow-up to clean up all helpers to be node-capable and remove this temporary helpers_converted directory / omit logic.
